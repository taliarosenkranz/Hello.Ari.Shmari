Goal:
Create a modern, creative, and fun one-page website for ARI, an AI-powered event assistant that automates guest communication, RSVP tracking, and event information management — primarily via WhatsApp.
Tone & Style:
Playful but sleek (think: Apple meets Notion meets WhatsApp)
Light animations, clean layout, big headlines
Make it feel effortless and smart — ARI should seem like the friendly AI that takes the stress out of event management
Use conversational, slightly witty language that makes users smile
Prioritize clarity: each section should make the visitor say, “Oh wow, this solves my exact problem.”
🖥️ Structure & Content:
1. Hero Section
Headline: “Let ARI handle your event chaos — one WhatsApp at a time.”
Subheadline: “No more manual messaging, guest confusion, or endless follow-ups. Just upload your guest list, and ARI does the rest.”
Call to Action: Buttons — “Try ARI” / “See How It Works”
Visual: Animated WhatsApp-style chat window showing ARI confirming RSVPs, answering questions, and sending reminders automatically.
2. The Problem
Title: “Let’s be honest. Event planning can be a mess.”
Use 3–4 quick illustrated pain points with short blurbs:
💬 “Sending hundreds of WhatsApp messages manually”
📊 “Losing track of who’s coming (and who’s ghosting)”
🧠 “Answering the same guest questions over and over”
🕓 “Updating clients manually, every. single. time.”
End with:
“It’s exhausting. You want to focus on the event, not spreadsheets and chats.”
3. The Simple Solution
Title: “Meet ARI — your AI assistant for guest communication.”
Copy:
“All you need is one Excel sheet with names and phone numbers.
ARI handles everything from there.”
Use icons to illustrate:
✅ Upload guest list
⚙️ ARI sets up automated WhatsApp invites
💬 Guests RSVP directly in chat
🧾 Client sees real-time status updates
Include:
“No coding. No stress. Just plug in your data and watch the magic happen.”
4. The Advanced Setup
Title: “Want to go deeper? ARI knows your event like you do.”
Copy:
“With our advanced setup, you can feed ARI every event detail — from dress code to gift preferences, from hotel suggestions to timing.”
“That way, when guests ask questions, ARI answers instantly and correctly — 24/7.”
Bullet points:
Location & schedule details
Dress code & theme
Accommodation options
Gift registry or payment links
Custom RSVP buttons (“Coming,” “Not coming,” “Ask me later”)
Include mini example:
Guest: “Hey, what’s the dress code again?”
ARI: “It’s formal — think black tie or cocktail chic 👗🎩”
5. Desktop Dashboard
Title: “Everything tracked. Nothing lost.”
Copy:
“ARI gives you a clean desktop dashboard where you can see every guest’s RSVP status, questions, and payment — in real time.”
Include visual mockup: event summary screen, RSVP stats, unanswered questions list, etc.
6. For Event Planners
Title: “Perfect for event agencies and planners.”
Copy:
“Whether you’re managing a wedding, corporate event, or private dinner — ARI keeps guests happy and your client informed.
Save hours every week and impress clients with your ‘AI-enhanced service’.”
7. Call to Action
Title: “Let ARI handle your next event.”
Copy:
“Upload your guest list today and experience stress-free event communication.”
Buttons:
“Get Started”
“Book a Demo”
Optional subline: “No setup cost. No coding. Just peace of mind.”
🎨 Design Notes:
Colors: light background with ARI’s green and muted neutrals
